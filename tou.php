<h1>Terms of Use</h1>
<h2>Online calendar service</h2>
<p><b>schmittens is currently in an open beta state.</b> This means that the site is still under development. Functionality may change, the site may be offline for updates, and we do not make any guarantees whatsoever about reliability of service at this point.</p>
<p>Having said that - you might be happy to hear that the core functionality will stay in place, and any data you enter will be accessible and safe (barring accidents, of course). We are very unlikely to remove features, but we plan on adding a whole bunch more.</p>
<p>So - by using this service you agree that:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Schmittens is not responsible for any errors or mistakes in the data published on this site, nor for any negative consequences arising from the use of this data or the service.</li>
	<li>Schmittens is not responsible for the content added to the site by it's users. Users take responsibility for all information uploaded, and they also confirm that they have the legal right to use any uploaded material (inlcuding pictures).</li>
	<li>We only allow events that are accessible to the general public. No private or invite only events.</li>
	<li>We only allow events that have entertainment-, informational or recreational character. </li>
	<li>Under no circumstances do we tolerate entries that promote hateful or exclusive worldviews of any kind.</li>
	<li>While events with a political aspect are generally ok we will not allow events if their main purpose is propagation of political ideas, parties or any other kind of organisation. </li>
	<li>Charging for access to events is fine, we do however not allow events if their main purpose is the sale of products and services.</li>
	<li>Misleading or wrong information about an event, it's purpose or location is not acceptable.</li>
	<li>When entering an event and/or location into the database you explicitly express that the information entered is correct and complete to the best of your knowledge at the time of writing.</li>
	<li>Information entered into the database by users can be modified or deleted without warning. This may happen if we update an event with new information, delete a canceled event or closed location, moderate information according to the rules set out above or for any other reason. We try to inform you if that happens to information you entered, but cannot guarantee it. </li>
	<li>By entering events on schmittens.net you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide and perpetual licence to use your entered data in any medium or context and for any purpose. This licence is granted free of charge, without any recompensation now or in the future. </li>
	 
</ul>
<h2>Export Interface</h2>
<p>By using the export option (via XML or other means) you agree that:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You will not use the data in any manner that could negatively impact the business, reputation, legal standing or any other aspect of Schmittens.net, it's staff or property or Schmitten's Partners. </li>
	<li>You will use the data for non-profit use only. If you are not sure if your use case constitutes non-proft use, please contact us. Commercial licenses are available for reasonable rates.</li>
	<li>You will attribute the data to Schmittens.net in any and all public uses. Every listed entity (event, location, exhibition, stage-event, festival) must provide a hyperlink to the source as provided in the feed.</li>

</ul>
<p>These Terms of Use are subject to change without warning or notification.</p>
